New feauters:
[] create animated gif with smooth transition from first image to second (I don't no is it possible or not)
[] save proportion ( as option because if we can have photo with not perpendicular shooting angle )
[] fine correction of markers
[] float menu in right part of screen with parameters of result image and markers

Bugfix:
[] correct jpeg saves for url
[] ie - wrong jpeg saving
